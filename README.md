## API Integration

This project uses the OpenWeatherMap API:
- Current Weather API: https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather
- 5-Day Forecast API: https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast
- Rate Limit: 60 calls/minute for free tier
- Units: Metric (Celsius)


## Troubleshooting

- **API Key Issues**: If you see an error about the API key, make sure you've correctly added it to the `.env` file.
- **City Not Found**: Check the spelling of the city name or try a more specific location (e.g., "London, UK" instead of just "London").
- **Rate Limiting**: The free tier of OpenWeatherMap API has a limit of 60 calls per minute. If you exceed this, you'll need to wait before making more requests.
